A simple example for M=12 and the first 6 columns of the data analysed in the paper.

Commands:
>> load('23D_dataset.mat');
>> M=12;
>> componentsizes=[14;497;13;20];
>> w1=stats(:,1:6);
>> [minpropB,kkk,matrixminpropB]=MVCS_allinone_withdiscrproj(w1,M,componentsizes);

Note: this combination of M and data columns is also analysed in the paper. Also, for that dataset, first we have the cryptocurrencies (14 of them), then the stocks (497 of them),
then the exchange rates (13 of them) and finally the commodities (20 of them). Hence, the specific order of these numbers in componentsizes above.


This should produce the following output:

Results for each component:

The maximum index value that provided perfect classification for component 1 was 0.18137
and the corresponding projection direction was
0.064705  -7.924e-18   7.924e-18     0.11207    -0.48296     0.86603
All projection directions that provided perfect classification had index values that were statistically significant.

No perfect classification for component 2
The best classification of the elements of this component, corresponding to the minimum misclassification proportion above, is as follows:
1 observations from component 2 are misclassified, i.e clustered with the observations from all other categories.
31 observations from other categories are misclassified, i.e. clustered together with the observations of component 2.

No perfect classification for component 3
The best classification of the elements of this component, corresponding to the minimum misclassification proportion above, is as follows:
1 observations from component 3 are misclassified, i.e clustered with the observations from all other categories.
531 observations from other categories are misclassified, i.e. clustered together with the observations of component 3.

No perfect classification for component 4
The best classification of the elements of this component, corresponding to the minimum misclassification proportion above, is as follows:
19 observations from component 4 are misclassified, i.e clustered with the observations from all other categories.
1 observations from other categories are misclassified, i.e. clustered together with the observations of component 4.
